#
# PROBLEM
# Someone shows you three hats and tells you that the there is a
# prize in one of them. He asks you to choose one of the hats. You
# choose one hat and tell him which one you chose. He then lifts one
# of the hats you didnâ€™t choose and there is nothing under that hat. 
# He then tells you that you can either stay with the hat you have 
# originally chosen or switch to the other remaining hat
#
#  IMPLEMENTATION
# This implementation will simulate the code over a range
# and show the overall results in the end.
